# MERN STACK E-Commerce Project

>

This is a standard E-Commerce project I am designing from scratch as a complete representation of my knowledge as a MERN STACK developer and impress whoever accesses my profile. This Project will ensure that I have learned how to build Web Applications highlighting the complex understanding through the detailed concepts used in this project. I will keep updating this project for better and will add other such Full Stack Projects using various tools and new concepts that I have at my disposal or will acquire along the way to become a Full Stack Web Developer.

- My main concern will be on the Server side of the project but as we move forward I will try to strike a balance between the Frontend and the Backend of the Project.
- The  project needs to be accurate in use of the modern tools and updated concepts.
- The project must be free from any and all runtime errors
